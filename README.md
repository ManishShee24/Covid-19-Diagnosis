# Covid-19-Diagnosis

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2, a novel RNA coronavirus from the same family as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was identified in early January 2020 as the cause of a pneumonia epidemic affecting the city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, from where it rapidly spread across China.

We carried out a systematic literature search using the main online databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, UpToDate, Embase and Web of Science) with the following keywords: ‘COVID-19’, ‘2019-nCoV’, ‘coronavirus’ and ‘SARS-CoV-2’. We included publications from 1 January 2019 to 3 April 2020 which focused on clinical features and treatments.
Here, we summarize the currently available data on the clinical features and treatment options for COVID-19.
